# Physics-Constrained Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (PhyCRNet)

This repository provides the official implementation of **PhyCRNet**, a physics-constrained convolutional recurrent neural network tailored to solve spatial-temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) with **arbitrary boundary conditions**. It is designed for scientific machine learning applications where labeled data is scarce or unavailable.

PhyCRNet extends traditional physics-constrained neural networks by introducing:

- **Boundary condition handling as soft constraints** via finite-difference-based differentiation
- **Adaptive loss weighting** to improve convergence and training efficiency
- **Convolutional + recurrent architecture** to model spatial-temporal dynamics
